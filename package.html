Fill in text templates with variable content.

<p>
This library lets you fill in a text template with some dynamic content, that
you will pass in a Hashtable object.

<p>
The intention was  to provide a mean to work  confortably with HTML in
Servlets, having in separate files the  HTML design and the Java code.
I have started this in the beginning of my Java learning.  Probably it
can be optimized.

<p>
This  library  was inspired by Perl Text::Template module (see http://www.cpan.org).
